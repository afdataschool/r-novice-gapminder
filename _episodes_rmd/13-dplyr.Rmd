```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("13-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header=TRUE)
```

Manipulation of dataframes means many things to many researchers, we often
select certain observations (rows) or variables (columns), we often group the
data by a certain variable(s), or we even calculate summary statistics. We can
do these operations using the normal base R operations:

```{r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa", "gdpPercap"])
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas", "gdpPercap"])
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", "gdpPercap"])
```

But this isn't very *nice* because there is a fair bit of repetition. Repeating
yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and potentially introduce some
nasty bugs.

## The `dplyr` package

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf)
package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating dataframes
in a way that will reduce the above repetition, reduce the probability of making
errors, and probably even save you some typing. As an added bonus, you might
even find the `dplyr` grammar easier to read.

Here we're going to cover 6 of the most commonly used functions as well as using
pipes (`%>%`) to combine them.

1. `select()`
2. `filter()`
3. `group_by()`
4. `summarise()`
5. `mutate()`

If you have have not installed this package earlier, please do so:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr')
```

Now let's load the package:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
```

### A brief detour to talk tibbles

As we saw previously, dataframes are the engine of R's power. The `dplyr` package introduces a new and improved version of the dataframe - the tibble. In effect, dataframes and tibbles are interchangeable - tibbles keep everything that works about dataframes, and adds a few nifty features.

You can convert a dataframe to a tibble by using `as_tibble()`, or you can use another package `readr`, which provides a `read_csv()` function that returns a tibble.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('readr')
```

We can now load the package and use `read_csv` to read the data into R as a tibble.
```{r}
library(readr)
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
gapminder
```

You can see that when we print gapminder now, instead of getting an unwieldy amount of output, we get a manageable preview, as well as some really useful information.

## Using `select()`

If, for example, we wanted to move forward with only a few of the variables in
our dataframe we could use the `select()` function. This will keep only the
variables you select.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder,year,country,gdpPercap)
```

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig1.png)

If we open up `year_country_gdp` we'll see that it only contains the year,
country and gdpPercap. 

### Pipes in R

Above we used 'normal' grammar, but the strengths of
`dplyr` lie in combining several functions using pipes. 

`dplyr` is arranged around verbs (select, filter, mutate, summarise), and pipes let us build up 'paragraphs'.

Since the pipes grammar is unlike anything we've seen in R before, let's repeat what we've done above using pipes.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year,country,gdpPercap)
```

To help you understand why we wrote that in that way, let's walk through it step
by step. First we summon the gapminder dataframe and pass it on, using the pipe
symbol `%>%`, to the next step, which is the `select()` function. In this case
we don't specify which data object we use in the `select()` function since in
gets that from the previous pipe. 

**Fun Fact**: The pipe in this context is very similar to what we saw in the shell. In R, a pipe symbol is `%>%` while in the shell it is `|` but the concept is the same! In R, we can't use `|` because it already has meaning (the logical "or").

### More powerful selections

We can do more than just select by typing names. You can use column indices:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(1:3)
```

Additionally, you can select based on the names of columns. `starts_with()`, `ends_with()` and `contains()` do exactly what they sound like.

{: .challenge}


## Using `filter()`

If we now wanted to move forward with the above, but only with European
countries, we can combine `select` and `filter`

```{r}
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>%
    filter(continent=="Europe") %>%
    select(year,country,gdpPercap)
```

> ## Challenge 3
>

>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 3

> >year_country_lifeExp_Africa <- gapminder %>%
> >                            filter(continent=="Africa") %>%
> >                            select(year,country,lifeExp)
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

As with last time, first we pass the gapminder dataframe to the `filter()`
function, then we pass the filtered version of the gapminder dataframe to the
`select()` function. **Note:** The order of operations is very important in this
case. If we used 'select' first, filter would not be able to find the variable
continent since we would have removed it in the previous step.

> > ```

## Using `arrange()`

The `arrange()` verb does exactly what it says - arrange rows according to the values in variables. To define which variables are to be used, they are supplied to arrange in order or priority. By default, the values are arranged in ascending order. To arrange by descending order, wrap a variable name in `desc()`.

## Using `group_by()` and `summarise()`

Now, we were supposed to be reducing the error prone repetitiveness of what can
be done with base R, but up to now we haven't done that since we would have to
repeat the above for each continent. Instead of `filter()`, which will only pass
observations that meet your criteria (in the above: `continent=="Europe"`), we
can use `group_by()`, which will essentially use every unique criteria that you
could have used in filter.

```{r}
str(gapminder)

str(gapminder %>% group_by(continent))
```
You will notice that the structure of the dataframe where we used `group_by()`
(`grouped_df`) is not the same as the original `gapminder` (`data.frame`). A
`grouped_df` can be thought of as a `list` where each item in the `list`is a
`data.frame` which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular
value `continent` (at least in the example above).

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig2.png)

## Using `summarise()`

The above was a bit on the uneventful side but `group_by()` is much more
exciting in conjunction with `summarise()`. This will allow us to create new
variable(s) by using functions that repeat for each of the continent-specific
data frames. That is to say, using the `group_by()` function, we split our
original dataframe into multiple pieces, then we can run functions
(e.g. `mean()` or `sd()`) within `summarise()`.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
```

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig3.png)

```{r,eval=FALSE}
continent mean_gdpPercap
     <fctr>          <dbl>
1    Africa       2193.755
2  Americas       7136.110
3      Asia       7902.150
4    Europe      14469.476
5   Oceania      18621.609
```

That allowed us to calculate the mean gdpPercap for each continent, but it gets
even better.

> ## Challenge 7

> Calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average life

> >lifeExp_bycountry %>%
> >    arrange(desc(mean_lifeExp))
> >```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

The function `group_by()` allows us to group by multiple variables. Let's group by `year` and `continent`.


```{r}
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarise(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
```

That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You're not limited to defining 1 new variable in `summarise()`.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarise(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop=mean(pop),
              sd_pop=sd(pop))
```

## `count()` and `n()`

A very common operation is to count the number of observations for each
group. The `dplyr` package comes with two related functions that help with this.

For instance, if we wanted to check the number of countries included in the
dataset for the year 2002, we can use the `count()` function. It takes the name
of one or more columns that contain the groups we are interested in, and we can
optionally sort the results in descending order by adding `sort=TRUE`:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2002) %>%
    count(continent, sort = TRUE)
```

If we need to use the number of observations in calculations, the `n()` function
is useful. For instance, if we wanted to get the standard error of the life
expectancy per continent:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(se_pop = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
```

You can also chain together several summary operations; in this case calculating the `minimum`, `maximum`, `mean` and `se` of each continent's per-country life-expectancy:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(
      mean_le = mean(lifeExp),
      min_le = min(lifeExp),
      max_le = max(lifeExp),
      se_le = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
```

## Using `mutate()`

We can also create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information using `mutate()`.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarise(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
```

## Connect mutate with logical filtering: `case_when`

When creating new variables, we can hook this with a logical condition. A simple combination of
`mutate()` and `case_when()` facilitates filtering right where it is needed: in the moment of creating something new.
This easy-to-read statement is a fast and powerful way of depending on particular  conditions.

```{r}
## Classifying data into groups depending on life expectancy
# Make categories based on life expectancy < 40, between 40 and 65, and > 65
lifeExp_categories <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(exp_cat = case_when(
      lifeExp < 40 ~ "less than 40",
      lifeExp >=40 & lifeExp < 65 ~ "between 40 and 65",
      lifeExp >=65 ~ "above 65"
      )) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    count(exp_cat)

lifeExp_categories
```

## Joining dataframes

It is extremely common that we have relevant data in more than one dataset. The dplyr package offers some very useful join functions to combine dataframes by common variables.

These functions take two dataframes and combine them based on matching values in common variables. 

`left_join()` keeps rows from the first dataframe, and adds matching values from the right dataframe.
`right_join()` does the reverse.
`inner_join()` only keeps rows that match between the two dataframes.
`full_join()` keeps all rows from both dataframes.
`anti_join()` only keeps rows from the first dataframe that *don't* match the second.

Let's make a couple of simple data.frames to demonstrate how a join works.

```{r}
df1 <- data_frame(sample = c(1, 2, 3),
                  measure1 = c(4.2, 5.3, 6.1))
df2 <- data_frame(sample = c(1, 3, 4),
                  measure2 = c(7.8, 6.4, 9.0))
```

Now we can use each of the joins on these two data.frames:

```{r}
left_join(df1, df2)
```

```{r}
right_join(df1, df2)
```

```{r}
full_join(df1, df2)
```

```{r}
anti_join(df1, df2)
```

For a more realistic example, let's use gapminder again.

Download the `gapminder_sex_ratios.csv` data from [here]({{ page.root }}/data/gapminder_sex_ratios.csv), and save it under our `/data` directory. Let's read that in and join it to our existing data.

```{r}
gapminder_sr <- read_csv("data/gapminder_sex_ratios.csv")
gapminder_sr

gapminder_left_join <- left_join(gapminder, gapminder_sr)
gapminder_left_join
```
