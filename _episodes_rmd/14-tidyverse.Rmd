```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(kableExtra)
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("13-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header=TRUE)
```

Data can come in many different shapes and forms, and often people invent whatever makes sense to them. This often means that a great deal of time is spent modifying data to be structured in a format that R can use.

Within R, different packages can have different expectations about data structures, which can make it difficult to move between functions in different packages.

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a subset of R packages that conform to a particular philosophy about data structure.

The concept of tidy data can be distilled into three principles. A data set can be considered 'tidy' if:

1. Each variable is in its own column
2. Each case is in its own row
3. Each value is in its own cell

```{r example-tidy, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
messy1 <- data.frame(id = 1:3,
                    rep1 = round(rnorm(3, 2), 2),
                    rep2 = round(rnorm(3, 2), 2))

tidy1 <- messy1 %>% 
  gather(rep, value, -id) %>% 
  mutate(rep = sub("rep", "", rep))

```

In the above the same variable (a measurement value) was stored in two different columns. In this case making the data tidy required converting those two columns into one, which made the dataset have twice as many rows. This is usually called going from "wide" to "long" format, which is often done in the simplest cases of tidying data.


> ## Challenge 3
>
> Open the file `examples/plates.xlsx`. This is a very common format to store data
> from 96-well plates. What would this look like if it was tidy? Discuss the steps you would need to go through to convert it to a tidy format.

As well as consistency of the underlying data structure, packages in the tidyverse are also all compatible with the `%>%` operator.

There is a tidyverse package, which doesn't have any functionality, except to import core packages of the tidyverse. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

is the equivalent of 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
```
